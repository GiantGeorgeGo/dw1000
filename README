DecaWave DW1000 802.15.4 UWB transceiver.

dw1000.c                contains the main driver implementation
tools/readflags.py      is a script that decodes status register flags,
                        useful for debugging the driver
devicetree/             contains device trees and on overlay for using the module
                        when connected to a Raspberry Pi 2 via the SPI0.0
